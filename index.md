## üëã Hello!

I am a fellow at Harvard, working in [Prof. Tyler VanderWeele](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tyler-vanderweele/)‚Äôs group. My current research builds causal model to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being.    
Previously, I was a research assistant advised by [Prof. Tim Althoff](http://timalthoff.de/) in the [Behavioral Data Science Lab](https://behavioral-data.github.io/) at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington.      

I recently graduated from ENSAE, [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en) with a MS in Computer Science and Statistics and from [ESSEC Business School](https://www.essec.edu/en/) with a Master in Management. During my studies, I was a data scientist intern at [Quantmetry](https://www.quantmetry.com/).

## üëÄ Research interests

I am broadly interested in causal inference, computational statistics and AI/ML for human health, behavior and well-being.   
Recently, I enjoyed using NLP, matching techniques and sensitivity analysis in the context of social media and mental health. In the past, I also had fun working on unsupervised reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks, auction theory and times series forecasting.

In my free time, when I am not cooking, I like reading and (occasionally) writing about sociology - [here]() is an attempt to write on the behavioral determinants of health.
