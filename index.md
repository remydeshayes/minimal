## üëã Hello!

I recently moved to London, UK and joined <a href="https://www.integrumesg.com/" target="_blank"> Integrum ESG</a> as the Lead Machine Learning Researcher.

Until recently, I was a Research Fellow at Harvard, working in <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tyler-vanderweele/" target="_blank"> Prof. Tyler VanderWeele</a>‚Äôs group. My current research builds causal models to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on health and well-being.    
Previously, I was a research assistant advised by <a href="http://timalthoff.de/" target="_blank"> Prof. Tim Althoff</a> in the <a href="https://behavioral-data.github.io/" target="_blank"> Behavioral Data Science Lab</a> at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle.      

I graduated from ENSAE, <a href="https://www.ip-paris.fr/en" target="_blank"> Institut Polytechnique de Paris</a> with a MS in Computer Science and Statistics and from <a href="https://www.essec.edu/en/" target="_blank"> ESSEC Business School</a> with a MS in Economics and Management. During my studies, I was a data scientist intern at <a href="https://www.quantmetry.com/" target="_blank"> Quantmetry</a>.

## üëÄ Research interests

I am very broadly interested in Causal Inference, Statistical Methodology for Complex High-Dimensional Data and Explainable, Robust and Fair ML.      

Recently, I enjoyed using NLP, matching techniques and sensitivity analysis in the context of social media and mental health - <a href="assets/papers/project_group_presentation.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a> are introductory slides from a brief talk I gave at UW in September 2020. In the past, I also had fun working on unsupervised reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks, parallel computing, auction theory and times series forecasting.

In my free time, when I am not cooking, I like reading and (occasionally) writing about sociology - <a href="assets/papers/essay_1.pdf" target="_blank"> Essay 1</a> and <a href="assets/papers/essay_2.pdf" target="_blank"> Essay 2</a> are two recent attempts to write about the behavioral determinants of health and the politics of health inequality.
